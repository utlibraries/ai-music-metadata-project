AI MUSIC WORKFLOW - CATALOGER GUIDE
===================================

How to use the files created by the AI music cataloging workflow to review results and sort physical items.

OVERVIEW
--------
This AI workflow processes CD images by extracting metadata from images using AI, searching OCLC for matching records, and using AI again to analyze matches and assign confidence scores (confidence scores are used to decide which items need review).  After this is done, there is an automated check of track listings and publication dates of OCLC results vs the initial metadata.  Results are downgraded if there are any mismatches.  Then, results are used to create final outputs.  The intention of the outputs is to simplify the organization of physical items and cataloging record creation.  It is an effective cataloging tool and is not meant to replace professional judgment. Always test thoroughly and maintain quality controls. 

STEPS AFTER RUNNING AUTOMATED WORKFLOW
======================================

1. Sort items using sorting spreadsheet 
2. Use cataloger review spreadsheet to track review progress - reference low confidence review text file in this process 
3. Use MARC text file to help with original cataloging where needed 
4. Upload high confidence and cataloger verified results to Library Services Platform 

KEY FILES CREATED
=================

1. SORTING SPREADSHEET: [cd/lp]-sort-groups-all-records-[date].xlsx
- Spreadsheet with all CDs categorized into groups (High Confidence, Held by UT Libraries, Low Confidence, Duplicates)

2.  BATCH UPLOAD FILE: batch-upload-alma-[cd/lp]-[timestamp].txt  
- Simplified, de-duplicated, pipe-delimited file for high-confidence matches
- Format: OCLC_NUMBER|BARCODE|TITLE

3. CATALOGER REVIEW SPREADSHEET: cataloger-review-[date].xlsx
- Tracking spreadsheet for reviewing low-confidence matches
- Yellow highlighting indicates items needing attention - once a cataloger enters an OCLC number for a row, it will no longer be highlighted
- Contains dropdown menu and notes for each low-confidence item 

4. LOW CONFIDENCE REVIEW TEXT FILE: low-confidence-review-[date].txt
- Text log with AI-Generated metadata, AI-suggested OCLC record, and other potential matches found for each low-confidence item

5. MARC TEXT FILE (FOR LOW CONFIDENCE ITEMS): low-confidence-marc-[date].txt
- MARC-formatted records based on initial AI-extracted metadata
- Can be used as a starting point to speed up original cataloging 
- Pared down to basics, and contains only fields with visible/available data

USING THE CATALOGER REVIEW SPREADSHEET
======================================

The cataloger-review-[date].xlsx file is your primary tool for handling low-confidence matches.

COLUMNS:
- Barcode: Physical item identifier
- Date AI Processed: When the workflow ran
- AI-Suggested OCLC Number: AI's best guess out of OCLC results (may be blank)
- Title: Title from OCLC record (or "No OCLC match found")
- Date Cataloger Checked: Cataloger to fill in
- Status: Dropdown with three options (see below)
- Correct OCLC Number: Auto-fills if AI suggested OCLC number is approved, or cataloger to manually enter
- Notes: Cataloger comments and observations

STATUS DROPDOWN OPTIONS:
1. "Approved" - AI suggestion is correct
   - Correct OCLC Number auto-fills with AI suggestion
   - Row highlighting disappears automatically

2. "Rejected - Different OCLC" - AI found wrong record
   - Manually enter correct OCLC number in Correct OCLC column
   - Row highlighting disappears when OCLC number entered

3. "Rejected - Needs Original Cataloging" - No OCLC record exists
   - Leave Correct OCLC Number blank
   - Use MARC format file as cataloging starting point
   - Once OCLC number created, it may be filled in and the row highlighting will disappear


SORTING PHYSICAL ITEMS
======================

The sort-groups-all-records spreadsheet is intended to help you to organize physical CDs:

1. HIGH CONFIDENCE - Alma Batch Upload
   - Simple and deduplicated, only high confidence results - intended for batch uploads to Library Services Platforms
   - Physical items can go directly to appropriate collection

2. HELD BY UT LIBRARIES (IXA)
   - Items already in catalog (according to the OCLC Search API)
   - Verify that these items are indeed duplicates and that the items in collection do not have condition issues
   - May need withdrawal processing

3. LOW CONFIDENCE - Cataloger Review
   - Use cataloger-review-[date].xlsx for decisions
   - Keep items accessible for hands-on verification
   - Sort based on cataloger review outcomes

4. DUPLICATES
   - Multiple copies of same title identified in this batch of processed items
   - Check condition and retention decisions
   - May keep best copy, withdraw others

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

For questions about specific OCLC records:
- Use the low confidence review text file and check OCLC for best options
- The Other Potential Matches in the low confidence text file may provide good alternative matches
- Verify against physical CD

QUALITY CONTROL
===============

The AI workflow provides multiple verification layers:
- Step 3: AI cross-references multiple data points
- Step 4: Verifies track listings and publication dates
- Step 5: Flags low-confidence matches for human review

In this context, AI is a tool to accelerate cataloging, not to replace professional judgment. When in doubt, follow standard cataloging practices and institutional policies.
